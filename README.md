# Conclusion to Class Attributes and Class Methods

## Learning Goals

- Use class attributes and methods to write durable and powerful code.
- Accomplish complex programming tasks using knowledge from previous modules.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Attribute**: variables that belong to an object.
- **Constant**: variable whose value cannot be changed.
- **Instance**: one specific working copy of a class. It is created when a
  class's `__init__` method is called.
- **Class**: a bundle of data and functionality. Can be copied and modified to
  accomplish a wide variety of programming tasks.
- **Static**: an attribute or method that cannot manipulate the class or
  instance it belongs to.
- **Exception**: an error that occurs during the execution of a program.
  Exceptions can be anticipated and handled without disrupting the execution of
  the program.

## Conclusion

In the past module, we got to know some essential aspects of programming in
Python: class variables and methods. You can do a quick check of the list of
topics we covered:

- How to recognize a class attribute.
- How to utilize class attributes.
- How to know when to define class methods.
- How to use class attributes to keep track of a class's data.
- The concept of remembrance in object-oriented programming.

That's a lot! But now you've seen how it all works and how you can use it to
level up your Python programming.
